Without login, anyone will only see the homepage, which contains all added videos. Users can watch videos from our site, & the view count will increase. But only logged in users can like/dislike the video.

Each video item will show the total video count, like count, dislike count, and detail button. On clicking the detail the button user will see the uploader's name & user list of who like & dislike the video.

Anyone can log in/signup, up and log out in-app using email/pass. After login the user will get access to his dashboard. In this dashboard, he will grant access to add YouTube videos.

He can also view the videos he uploaded (added).
